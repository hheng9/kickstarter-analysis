# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to compare, review, or dissect multiple and various crowdfunding kickstarter projects. We analyzed the kickstarter data from every angle by applying filters, formulas, pivot tables, charts, and calculations to display our findings.

## Analysis and Challenges

### I began performing my analysis by filtering the necessary categories from the kickstarter worksheet. I then migrated the information over to a pivot table so I could better organize the correct fields accordingly. After completing the pivot table I inserted the appropriate chart from the data collected. The more successful outcomes based on launch dates began to rise only through mid year whereas the failed and canceled stayed somewhat consistant throughout the year. May and June had the most successful and failed launches which meant there were morte attempts performed in thos months overall.

## Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Outcomes based on goals had a higher success and fail rates with the lower goal values. The lower goal values brought a higher success percentages and as the goal values increased then so did the failed percentages. There is not much data to take from the number of canceled projects.

## Outcomes Based on Goals

### The biggest challenge for me was trying to understand the formula definitions and error codes for my formula entries. I overcame these issues through trial & error , practicing the lessons over & over again, and performing more research as needed.

## Results

- Theater outcomes based on launch dates were most successful in the months of May and June.

- There are zero projects canceled for the outcomes based on goals. 

- One limitations of this dataset would be the information given could be out of date or not current.

- It is possible to create many other tables & graphs using different categories/subcategories such as music & rock filtered by countries, outcomes, or dealines.
