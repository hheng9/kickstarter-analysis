# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to compare, review, or dissect multiple and various crowdfunding kickstarter projects. We analyze the kickstarter data from every angle by applying filters, formulas, pivot tables, charts, and calculations to display our findings.

## Analysis and Challenges

### I began performing my analysis by filtering the necessary categories from the kickstarter worksheet. I then migrated the information over to a pivot table so i could organize the correct fiels accordingly.After completing the pivot table I inserted the appropriate chart from the data collected. The more successful outcomes based on launch dates began to rise only through mid year whereas the failed and canceled stayed somewhat consistant throughout the year. May and June had the most successful and failed launches which meant there were more attempts performed in those months overall.

## Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Outcomes based on goals had a higher success and fail rates with the lower goal values. The lower goal values brought a higher success percentage and as the goal value increased then so the fail percentage. There is not much data to take from the number of canceled projects.

## Outcomes Based on Goals

### The biggest challenge for me was trying to understand the formula definitions and receiving error codes for my formula entries. I overcame these issues through trial & error , practicing the lessons over & over again, and performing more research as needed.

## Results

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

### Theater outcomes based on launch dates were most successful in the months of May and June. Winter, spring and fall had more failed attempts of launching. 

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

### As we can see there are zero projects canceled for the outcomes based on goals. There were more projects performed and a higher success rate for the total project with lesser goals.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?

### Limitations of this dataset could be the information given is out of date, the information is not current, or there needs to be a wider range of information. 

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

### You could create many other tables & graphs using different categories/subcategories such as music & rock filtered by countries, outcomes, or dealines.
